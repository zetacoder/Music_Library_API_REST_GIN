# music-album-library-api-rest-gin
Simple API REST to create, delete and get music albums using Go and GIN framework. To test the application i used POSTMAN in order to emule GET, POST, PUT and DELETE http methods.

In order to maintain the simplicity, and show easily the HTTP requests, i made a list of 10 music albums alocated in the base code. In the near future, i will implement a conecction with DB.
